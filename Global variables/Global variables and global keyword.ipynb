    "## Global variables\n",
    "* Global variables are variables declared outside any function and are accessible throughout the program.\n",
    "* These variables are stored in the global scope, which is shared across all functions and modules within the same file (or imported files).\n",
    "\n",
    "## global keyword\n",
    "The global keyword in Python is used to declare that a variable inside a function refers to a global variable, meaning a variable that is defined outside the function. By default, variables assigned within a function are considered local to that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use global?\n",
    "1) Reassigning a global variable:\n",
    "  If you want to assign a new value or object to the global variable, use global.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Declaring a new global variable inside a function:\n",
    "   If you want to create a global variable from inside a function, use global.\n",
    "   \n",
    "## When NOT to Use global?\n",
    "1) Reading global variables:\n",
    "   If you're only reading a global variable and not modifying it, you donâ€™t need global\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Modifying contents of a mutable global object:\n",
